Modification of the library for DFRobot's SEN0539 (DF2301Q) Voice Recognition module to MicroPython and CircuitPython for use with the Raspberry Pi Pico (RP2040)

Code was modified from DFRobot's ( https://github.com/DFRobot/DFRobot_DF2301Q ) Raspberry Pi Python code to work with both CircuitPython and MicroPython. UART code was not included because I only needed I2C and so didn't bother porting the UART interface. This was a fast conversion so there's bound to be bugs and things done incorrectly, but I saw quite a few people online looking for this and figured I might be able to speed up someone's project.

## Usage

### Summary

- This library can be used to both send commands to, and read command IDs from the DFRobot Gravity speech recognition board.
- Possible operations include setting wake (listening) state duration, muting/unmuting the board, setting volume, entering wake (listening) state, and reseting the module.
- Reading from the module gives an integer corresponding to the Command IDs which are described here ( https://wiki.dfrobot.com/SKU_SEN0539-EN_Gravity_Voice_Recognition_Module_I2C_UART )

### Installation

- Include the `DFRobot_DF2301Q.py` file alongside your code. Examples of how to use this library are included in `code.py` for CircuitPython and `main.py` for MicroPython.
